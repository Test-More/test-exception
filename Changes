0.12  Mon Aug 26 2002 2002
    -   patched return.t so that it skips if we don't have a 
        Test::Harness that can handle TODO tests (thanks to 
        <chromatic@rmci.net> for pointing this out).
    -   tweaked POD and README
    -   Fixed prototypes

0.11  Sat Jun 29 2002
    -   corrected README file
    -   refactored code a little
    -   minor tweaks to POD
    -   Added test to Exception.t that demonstrated bug in throws_ok
        (you couldn't regex an empty string - i.e. normal exit).
    -   Fixed bug.

0.10  Sun Jun 2 2002
    -   Stopped over-exuberant pod.t and documented.t checking that 
        other peoples modules were documented and had legal POD!
    -   Couple of minor tweaks to the docs.
    -   Added caller.t and patch to Exception.pm from Michael G Schwern 
        to stop dies_ok, lives_ok and throws_ok interfering with 
        caller(). Much better than the regex hack added in 0.08 --- 
        which has now been removed.

0.09  Sat Jun 1 2002
    -   Fixed poor English in throws_ok docs.

0.08  Fri May 31 2002
    -   Added reference to Test::Inline to docs
    -   Test::More now in PREREQ_PM
    -   Culled some code that could never be called
    -   Added t/pod.t and t/documented.t
    -   Now bails if cannot load module in tests
    -   Fixed typo of Text::Differences in docs
    -   Added stacktrace.t to demontrate error reported by Janek 
        Schleicher <bigj@kamelfreund.de> where a stacktrace in the 
        exception can cause throws_ok to always succeed.
    -   Stopped stacktrace.t failing.

0.07  Fri Apr 12 2002
    -   may_be_regex -> maybe_regex in Test::Builder

0.06
    -   couple of minor tweaks to the docs

0.05
    -   now uses may_be_regex public method from Test::Builder
    -   should work & test under 5.005, don't have a perl to hand
        to double check so feedback welcome

0.04
    -   Can now pass regex-like strings as well as regexes. Thanks to 
        Mark Fowler for the suggestion and Michael G Schwern for adding
        code to Test::Builder.

0.03  Tue Apr 9 2002
    -   dies_ok, lives_ok & throws_ok now all return the result of the 
        underlying ok
    -   $@ is now guaranteed to be preserved (and is documented as 
        such). Thanks to Michael G Schwern for suggesting this.
    -   Tests run tainted, strict & with warnings 
        (just to be on the safe side :-)

0.02  Tue Apr 9 2002
    -   Documented properly

0.01  Wed Mar 20 00:18:07 2002
